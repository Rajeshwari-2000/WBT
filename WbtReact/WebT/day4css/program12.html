		Lord Ganesha is one of the most revered Hindu gods in the state of Maharashtra. Thus, Ganesh Chaturthi is one of the most vivaciously celebrated festivals in Pune. As the name suggests, the festival falls on the fourth day of the bright fortnight of Bhadrapada, which, as per the Georgian calendar, coincides with the months of August-September. The revelry of this festival continues for five to ten days as during this period, people buy idols of Lord Ganesha and keep them in their homes as a divine guest. Later, the images, accompanied by grand processions, are taken to a well, river or sea and ceremoniously submerged in the water.</div>
