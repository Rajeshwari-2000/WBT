    <P>
        Festivals are the oldest rituals and traditions our countrymen follow to pay tribute to the almighty gods and goddesses. In fact, these celebrations are nothing but the symbols of peace and happiness. India is a diverse country with multiple religions and cultures conglomerated in a single form.
    </P>

    <h2>Festivals are occasions that bring people closer, fostering a sense of unity and brotherhood. They allow us to set aside our differences and come together to celebrate the joy and happiness that these occasions bring.</h2>
